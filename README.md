Project: Cats and Dogs Classifier Using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

In this project, we aim to build an image classification model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and our goal is to create a robust model capable of accurately classifying these two animal groups.

Project Steps:

Data Analysis:
Explore and understand patterns within the Kaggle dataset containing cat and dog images.
Data Preprocessing:
Perform essential preprocessing tasks, including image resizing, normalization, and dataset splitting for training and testing.
Feature Extraction:
Extract relevant features from the images to serve as input for the SVM model.
Model Implementation:
Design and train an SVM model specifically for image classification, utilizing the selected features.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using separate test data.
Assess key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Fine-Tuning:
Explore hyperparameter tuning to optimize the SVM model for better classification results.
Key Takeaways:

Image Classification: Gain practical experience in creating image classification models using machine learning techniques.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Understand how SVMs efficiently perform binary classification tasks.
Data Preprocessing: Enhance skills in preparing image data for machine learning, including resizing and normalization.
Model Evaluation: Learn to interpret evaluation metrics for image classification tasks.
Kaggle Dataset: Gain insights into real-world data challenges and best practices when constructing datasets.
This project was completed during a machine learning internship at Prodigy Infotech.
